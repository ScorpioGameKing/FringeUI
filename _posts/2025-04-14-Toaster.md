## Toaster Overview

A very simple timed MsgBox alternative. It can be used as a regular MsgBox by setting the
duration to 0, otherwise it's meant to be used for toast notifications.

### Toast

The Sub used to create a Toast style MsgBox that naturally times out without interaction.

```vb
Sub Toast(msg As String, duration As Integer, title As String, button_type As Integer)
    CreateObject("WScript.Shell").PopUp msg, duration, title, button_type
End Sub
```
- msg
    : The actual text displayed in the notificaton
- duration
    : How long until the notification disappears. Interacting stops it from timing out
- title
    : The title of the notification window
- button_type
    : An integer representing the type of window interface (Yes/No, Yes Only, etc)

To Call:

```vb
Toaster.Toast "Hello World!", 1, "Hi There", 4096
```

Creates:
